# Docker Mastery: The Complete Toolset From a Docker Captain

## About 

Docker is will be used by everyone in devOps

Docker is about speed; the speed of development and deployments. Where you can
package an application and run/test/develop anywhere on any operating system.

As there is a ton of legacy code 80% of a developer job is maintenance on older
code. This code can be containerized without actual code changes.

Docker started and is still *mainly* open source. And every year there is a
birthday party for the Docker release.
